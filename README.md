# HS_HSSW_quench_NESCGLE
A code to compute the mobility function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\;b(t;\phi,T_f,T_i=\infty)" title="b(t,phi,Tf,Ti)" /> of a quench for the Hard Sphere (HS) + Square Well system starting from an infinite initial temperature (HS limit) to a finite final temperature through the "Non-equilibrium self-consistent generalized Langevin equation" formalism.

<h2>Installation guide:</h2>

This program is written in Fortran 2003, make sure to have a fortran compiler and GNU make utility.
The make file does utilize gfortran as main command to compile (line 4 of Makefile), make sure to modify it to
accordingly to your compiler. gcc options -ffast-math -o3 are used but not necessary (lines 6 and 7 of Makefile).

Tested with gcc version 7.1.0

To install simply execute the command "make" while being in this folder.

<h2>Execution guide:</h2>

To execute the program simply run the file "program.out" generated by "make" inside this folder.
